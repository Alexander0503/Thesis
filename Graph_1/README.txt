README:
This repository contains a file and code for a graph created using the R program, which represents the fatalities rate per 100,000 in Israel during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The graph was created using the ggplot2 package with additional packages.
The original file of the dataset was downloaded from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/israel.
The graph also shows the main related COVID-19 events and two interruption points in March 2020 and February 2021.
