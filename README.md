# Thesis: Trends in the emergency department of chest pain visits and acute coronary syndrome (ACS) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel 2018-2021: interrupted time series analysis.
The main objective was to assess the nationwide ED visits from general hospitals trends for chest pain and ACS by subgroups in the population during different phases of the pandemic and related events in Israel.

Interrupted time series analysis (ITS) was used for the method design. It included two interruptions (2 change points), and Generalized least squares (GLS) with an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) structure seasonally adjusted was used to build predicted models with estimated reference trendline (counterfactual) in the absence of the pandemic and the interruptions, based on 26 months before the pandemic.

The "Models and Analysis" folder contains the R code for men 65 and above with acute coronary syndrome. It presents the complete analysis process done only for this cardiac outcome group. This Group was one of 6 total cardiac outcomes included in the complete thesis analysis.
The analysis contains: fitting the model (seasonality adjusting), testing the models (ACF, PACF, box test, AIC), checking other potential models, building the graphs (seasonality plot, 2-axis graphs, ITS graph with two interruptions), and other statistical analysis.
