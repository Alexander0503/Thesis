# Thesis: Trends in the emergency department of chest pain visits and acute coronary syndrome before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel 2018-2021: interrupted time series analysis.
the main objective was to assess the nationwide ED visits from general hospitals trends for chest pain and ACS by subgroups in the population during different phases of the pandemic and related events in Israel.
Interrupted time series analysis (ITS) was used for method design, and Generalized least squares (GLS) with an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) structure seasonally adjusted was used to build predicted models with estimated reference trendline (counterfactual) in the absence of the pandemic and the interruptions, based on 26 months before the pandemic. 

Statistical analyses were performed in R Software.
